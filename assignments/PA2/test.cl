(*
 *  This file shows how to implement a list data type for lists of integers.
 *  It makes use of INHERITANCE and DYNAMIC DISPATCH.
 *
 *  The List class has 4 operations defined on List objects. If 'l' is
 *  a list, then the methods dispatched on 'l' have the following effects:
 *
 *    isNil() : Bool		Returns true if 'l' is empty, false otherwise.
 *    head()  : Int		Returns the integer at the head of 'l'.
 *				If 'l' is empty, execution aborts.
 *    tail()  : List		Returns the remainder of the 'l',
 *				i.e. without the first element.
 *    cons(i : Int) : List	Return a new list containing i as the
 *				first element, followed by the
 *				elements in 'l'.
 *
 *  There are 2 kinds of lists, the empty list and a non-empty
 *  list. We can think of the non-empty list as a specialization of
 *  the empty list.
 *  The class List defines the operations on empty list. The class
 *  Cons inherits from List and redefines things to handle non-empty
 *  lists.
 *)

 -- Note how the dynamic dispatch mechanism is responsible to end
   -- the while loop. As long as mylist is bound to an object of 
   -- dynamic type Cons, the dispatch to isNil calls the isNil method of
   -- the Cons class, which returns false. However when we reach the
   -- end of the list, mylist gets bound to the object that was
   -- created by the (new List) expression. This object is of dynamic type
   -- List, and thus the method isNil in the List class is called and
   -- returns true.

(*
 *  Cons inherits all operations from List. We can reuse only the cons
 *  method though, because adding an element to the front of an emtpy
 *  list is the same as adding it to the front of a non empty
 *  list. All other methods have to be redefined, since the behaviour
 *  for them is different from the empty list.
 *
 *  Cons needs two attributes to hold the integer of this list
 *  cell and to hold the rest of the list.
 *
 *  The init() method is used by the cons() method to initialize the
 *  cell.
